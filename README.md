# Usage

## Release

Use the `./bin/release.sh` Bash script to perform a new release. It will ask you questions
as well as driving all the required commands, performing the necessary operation automatically.
The Bash script runs in dry-mode by default, so you can check first that everything is all right.

Releases are performed using [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/).
