### StreamingFast Firehose NEAR Types

Protobuf definitions when dealing with Firehose NEAR chain(s) like NEAR Mainnet and NEAR Testnet.

Foremost, this provides [sf.near.types.v1.Block](https://buf.build/streamingfast/firehose-near/docs/main:sf.near.type.v1#sf.near.type.v1.Block) which is used for consuming Firehose & Substreams NEAR block model.

This is probably the only model you should really care about, the rest are meant for internal communications for Firehose operators.
